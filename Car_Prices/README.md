# Car Price Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes factors affecting car prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to predict car prices based on various features.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)
- **Size:** 250 entries with 26 features
- **Features Include:**
  - Car specifications (engine size, horsepower, etc.)
  - Physical attributes (length, width, height)
  - Categorical features (fuel type, body type, etc.)
  - Target variable: Price
